It is possible to use HL at various levels. The CORE level allows the use of CMSIS plus the
standard peripheral libraries of the relevant MPU. 

- CMSIS
  Allows to use only CMSIS and access to the registers of the chosen MPUS.
  
- STM32F1
  It is the standard peripheral library by ST Microelectronics for MPUs of family STM32F1xx.
  It adds proper functions for the internal peripherals of the MPU.
  
- STM32F4
  It is the standard peripheral library by ST Microelectronics for MPUs of family STM32F4xx.
  It adds proper functions for the internal peripherals of the MPU.  
  
  
The CORE layer can be used in two ways:
1. CMSIS only:      see file hl.core.cmsis.readme.txt for more details
2. CMSIS+STM32Fx:   see file hl.core.stm32fx.readme.txt for more details.
