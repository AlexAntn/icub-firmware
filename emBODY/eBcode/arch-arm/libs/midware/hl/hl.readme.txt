It is possible to use HL at various levels. In the following are listed from lowest level to high.

LEVELS OF HL

- CORE
  It is he lowest level. It is taken from ARM/ST Microelectronics distributed code.
  - CMSIS
    Allows to use only CMSIS and access to the registers of the chosen MPUS. In hl\core\cmsis there is 
    what is needed. See hl.core.cmsis.readme.txt file for more details.
  - CMSIS+STM32F1/2/4
    Allows to integrate the CMSIS with the ST standard peripheral library for MPUS of families STM32F1(2)(4).
    In  hl\core\cmsis + hl\core\stm32f1(2)(4) there is what is needed. See hl.core.readme.txt file for more details. 
  
- PLUS
  Extends the CORE with services which are built using CORE. For instance there is a simple I2C driver, 
  system utilities, support to some chips (EEPROMs, accelerometer, gyroscope).
