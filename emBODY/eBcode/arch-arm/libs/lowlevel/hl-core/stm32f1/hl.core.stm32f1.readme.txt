It is possible to use HL at various levels. The hl-core/stm32f1 adds to hl-core/cmsis some extra functionalities provided
by ST Microelectronics with the standard peripheral library for MPUs of family STM32F1xx.


- STM32F1
  Adds to CMSIS the support of peripherals specific of STM32F1xx MPUs. 
  To use STM32F1 it is necessary to start from a CMSIS project and then to add the hl-core/stm32f1/src files.
  The header file hl-core/stm32f1/api/stm32f1.h give access to whatever the library offers.

  
  The STM32 files are coming from original ST distribution. They however have some changes, all marked with IIT-EXT tag.
  1. It is forced inclusion of hl-core/cmsis/api files with the purpose to prevent the compiler to use old files with the same name
     which it finds in its system include folders.
  2. It is added a CRC_CalcBlockCRC_networkorder() function.
