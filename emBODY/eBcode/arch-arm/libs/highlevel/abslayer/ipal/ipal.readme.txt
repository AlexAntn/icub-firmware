    caveat:
    ipal requires tcpnet v4.13, which is omitted from the distribution because for it it is required a direct
    license from www.keil.com
    
    fake library:
    however, it is here included a fake library in ./lib/ipla.fake.cm4.lib which can be used to compile
    application which require ipal. the applications can also run, but ... obviously the network will not work.
    the project for the fake ipal is in ./ipal-fake.uvprojx
