 
    in here there are files used to interface towards keil-arm's tcpnet version 4.13.
    some files are entirely written by iit, some others are written by iit but wraps or contain data 
    structures and variable names contained in other files of the keil's distribution, and last but not least
    ... there is also the tcpnet library file.
    
    they are:
    - ipal_ipiit_storage[c, _hid.h, .h]
    - ipiit.h
    - rtl_baseiit.h
    - rtl_ipiit.h
    - rtl_ipiit_definitions.h
    - TCP_CM3-v413.lib    

    we omit all the above files to be sure to respect the license agreement that iit has with arm holdings
    for the use, modification and distribution of the tcpnet library.
